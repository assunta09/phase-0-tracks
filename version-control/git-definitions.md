# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? --> Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files and merge revisions made by several people. This is useful for two reasons:
  1. several people can work on a file simultaniously
  2. while making changes the master stays the same.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? --> A branch is a copy of the master. I would use a branch to make changes to the original file without changing the original
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit are saved changes. A good commit message explains what was changed in an explicit manner
* What is a merge conflict? -->The current branch and the branch you want to merge into the current branch have diverged. That is, you have commits in your current branch which are not in the other branch, and vice versa.
