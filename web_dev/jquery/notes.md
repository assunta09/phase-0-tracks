1. Find out what exactly jquery is
2. Create document to note down most important findings
3. Google for good resources on how to learn jquerry
4. Structure document add interesting facts, test the code I found.

The strategy went well. I first found out what jquery exactly is. I noted down my findings in a document. 

I mostly used codeacademy to get the basics and then w3 school to learn about the set-up. Then I tested what I learned in the file I built.
